# Global-happiness-report

## Overview 
This project involves analyzing the 2017 World Happiness Report dataset, which was published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The data was collected through surveys conducted by the Gallup World Poll from over 160 countries in more than 140 languages. The report evaluates various factors influencing people's well-being and assigns a Happiness Score to each country based on seven key criteria:

1. GDP per Capita
2. Healthy Years of Life Expectancy
3. Social Support (having someone to rely on in times of trouble)
4. Trust (measured as an absence of corruption in government and business)
5. Freedom (to make life decisions)
6. Generosity (measured by recent donations)
7. Dystopia (benchmark for the lowest possible scores in all criteria)

The report also ranks countries by happiness levels and includes information on job satisfaction.

## Tools and Libraries 
This project uses the following Python libraries:

-Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
